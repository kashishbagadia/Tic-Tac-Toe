# Tic-Tac-Toe
#### Tic Tac Toe is an evergreen, simple and easy game. This tic-tac-toe game is developed using Android Studio, the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system, designed specifically for Android development. It is played between two players,(say) X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
